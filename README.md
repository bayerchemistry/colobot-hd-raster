<h1>HD Textures for Colobot: Gold Edition</h1>
This repository contains new textures for Colobot: Gold game. All textures was created from scratch, based on original ones created by Daniel Roux.

To check it out you must download and install Colobot: Gold (original Colobot from Epsitec won't work with external textures) from https://colobot.info/download-colobot-gold/. 

<h2>Completely new, old world</h2>
With HD textures you be able to discover planets and objects again. Just stop for a while to see differences between 2001 and 2018 version. Starting from UI (made by my mates from TerranovaTeam) across robots and wheels and endings on beautiful sky textures. This is insane.

<h2>Consider about supporting our project of remake this marvelous game.</h2>
We, the Terranova Team (special force of International Colobot Community), awaits for every talented person, who wanna help. We need graphic designers, engineers, programists, sound makers and composers. More info awaits here https://colobot.info/icc/. Became one of us, and <b>MAKE COLOBOT GREAT AGAIN</b>!

<h6>This project is not finished yet. Some textures may be not finished or even missing.</h6>
