<h1>HD Textures for Colobot: Gold Edition</h1>
This repository contains new textures for Colobot: Gold game. All textures was created from scratch, based on original ones.

To check it out you must download and install Colobot: Gold (original Colobot from Epsitec won't work with external textures) from https://colobot.info/download-colobot-gold/. 

<h2>Completely new, old world</h2>
With HD textures you be able to discover planets and objects again. Just stop for a while to see differences between 2001 and 2018 version. Starting from UI (made by my mates from TerranovaTeam) across robots and wheels and endings on beautiful sky textures. This is insane.

<h2>Correct mistakes or even do it yourself!</h2>
Feel free to remix my textures. You can change details, colors and many other stuff. Personalize this fascinating game to your preferences with any graphic editing program. Feel like a game designer and enjoy the pleasure of playing on your rules.

<h2>Consider about supporting our project of remake this marvelous game.</h2>
We, the Terranova Team (special force of International Colobot Community), awaits for every talented person, who wanna help. We need graphic designers, engineers, programists, sound makers and composers. More info awaits here https://colobot.info/icc/. Became one of us, and <b>MAKE COLOBOT GREAT AGAIN</b>!
