<h1>HD Textures for Colobot: Gold Edition</h1>
This repository contains new textures for Colobot: Gold game. All textures was created from scratch, based on original ones created by Daniel Roux.

To check it out you must download and install Colobot: Gold (original Colobot from Epsitec won't work with external textures) from https://colobot.info/download-colobot-gold/.

<h2>Completely new, old world</h2>
With HD textures you be able to discover planets and objects again. Just stop for a while to see differences between 2001 and 2018 version. Starting from UI (made by my mates from TerranovaTeam) across robots and wheels and endings on beautiful sky textures. This is insane.
